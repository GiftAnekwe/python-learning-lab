# Python Lab 🧪🐍

This repository documents my Python learning journey with a strong focus on hands-on practice and problem solving.

The repository contains multiple `.py` files, with the `test.py` file holding my 'notes' from the beginner Python programming track on **CodeDex**.
It includes my answers to exercises, free exploration, and in several cases my own rewritten or extended versions of the original exercise solutions. This file reflects my early-stage learning process and experimentation.

Beyond `test.py`, the remaining files are project-based implementations created after completing the course. Each project file is designed to either solve a specific problem or act as a prototype that applies core Python concepts in a practical way.
These projects were built through additional research and deliberate practice to reinforce real-world application.

The `test.py` file was intentionally named and used as a sandbox to practice version control workflows. It allowed me to gain hands-on experience pushing code from VS Code to GitHub while learning Python simultaneously.

### Key Focus Areas 🚀
- Core Python fundamentals
- Problem solving and logical thinking
- Writing readable and maintainable code
- Translating concepts into working prototypes
- Hands-on use of Git and GitHub for version control

This repository represents continuous learning, iteration, and growth. New projects will continue to be added as each file evolves into a clearer solution or prototype addressing a defined problem.
