# Learning Lab 🧪🐍

This repository documents my Python learning journey with a strong focus on hands-on practice and implementation.

The `test.py` file was intentionally named and used as a sandbox to practice version control workflows. It allowed me to gain hands-on experience pushing code from VS Code to GitHub while learning Python simultaneously.

### Key Focus Areas 🚀
- Core Python fundamentals
- Problem solving and logical thinking
- Writing readable and maintainable code
- Translating concepts into working prototypes
- Hands-on use of Git and GitHub for version control
